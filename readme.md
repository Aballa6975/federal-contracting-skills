# 1102tools Claude Skills

Claude Skills for federal acquisition deliverables: SOW / PWS, IGCEs, OT project descriptions, OT cost analyses. Six orchestration skills that handle scope decisions, cost buildup, FAR citations, and document generation.

**Before you build:** Not every acquisition capability should be an AI tool. Dozens of potential skills were evaluated and several were intentionally excluded because they cross the line from data assembly into professional judgment. See **[ai-boundaries.md](ai-boundaries.md)**.

## Companion repo: MCPs for API data

For federal API data (SAM.gov, BLS wages, GSA CALC+ rates, GSA Per Diem, USASpending, eCFR, Federal Register, Regulations.gov), use the companion repo:

**[federal-contracting-mcps](https://github.com/1102tools/federal-contracting-mcps)** — eight MCP servers packaged as Claude Desktop Extensions (`.mcpb`). One-click install. No Terminal. No JSON config editing. API keys prompted at install time.

The two repos work together: MCPs handle data, skills handle deliverables.

## Why the split

The five API data-source skills (BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, GSA Per Diem, SAM.gov, USASpending) were removed from this repo in April 2026. They moved to the MCP companion repo.

**Reasons:**

1. **Deterministic tool calls.** MCP servers execute tested Python code. Claude does not generate API-call code on the fly. Skills drifted across runs; MCPs do not. Same input, same output.
2. **One-click install for Claude Desktop.** `.mcpb` bundles prompt for API keys at install time and register tools automatically. Contracting officers install them the same way they install any app.
3. **Less context cost.** Tool schemas are ~100 tokens each. The old API skills cost 500-1000 lines of context per run.
4. **Production-hardened.** Each MCP went through 3-6 audit rounds with live testing against the production API. Roughly 350 bugs fixed during hardening across the eight MCPs.
5. **Cross-client support.** MCP is an open standard. Same servers run in Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Zed, Continue.

The orchestration skills in this repo stay as skills. Their value is decision trees, FAR-compliant narrative, and document generation, not API calls.

## The orchestration skills

### FAR contracts

| Skill | Requires | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| [SOW/PWS Builder](skills/sow-pws-builder) | — | Structured scope decision tree producing contract-file-ready SOW or PWS. FAR 37.102(d) compliant: staffing handoff for the IGCE Builder delivered as chat output, never embedded in the document body. |
| [IGCE Builder: FFP](skills/igce-builder-ffp) | BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, GSA Per Diem MCPs | Firm-fixed-price IGCEs with layered wrap rate buildup (fringe, overhead, G&A, profit). |
| [IGCE Builder: LH/T&M](skills/igce-builder-lh-tm) | BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, GSA Per Diem MCPs | Labor Hour and Time-and-Materials IGCEs with burden multiplier pricing. |
| [IGCE Builder: Cost-Reimbursement](skills/igce-builder-cr) | BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, GSA Per Diem MCPs | CPFF, CPAF, CPIF IGCEs with fee structure analysis and statutory fee caps. |

### Other Transactions (OT)

| Skill | Requires | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| [OT Project Description Builder](skills/ot-project-description-builder) | — | Milestone-based project descriptions for prototype OT agreements under 10 USC 4021/4022. Replaces the SOW/PWS for OTs: structures work around TRL progression phases and go/no-go gates. Handles NDC, small business, traditional (with cost sharing), and consortium-brokered agreements. |
| [OT Cost Analysis](skills/ot-cost-analysis) | BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, GSA Per Diem MCPs | Should-cost estimates and price reasonableness analyses for OT agreements. Milestone-based pricing citing 10 USC 4021 instead of FAR 15.404. Handles cost-sharing math, consortium management fees, fixed-price and cost-type milestone payments. |

"Requires" lists the MCP servers each skill calls at runtime. Install them from the companion repo.

## Install

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).
2. Install the MCPs you need from [federal-contracting-mcps](https://github.com/1102tools/federal-contracting-mcps) (one-click, `.mcpb` files).
3. Download a skill folder from this repo. In Claude Desktop: **Customize > Skills > + > Create skill > Upload a skill**. Drag in each `skill.md` file individually.
4. Ask naturally. The skill reads its instructions and calls the MCP tools.
