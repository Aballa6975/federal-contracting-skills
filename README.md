Claude Skills for federal acquisition professionals.

**Before you build:** Not every acquisition capability should be an AI tool. Dozens of potential skills were evaluated and several were intentionally excluded because they cross the line from data assembly into professional judgment.

See **[AI-BOUNDARIES.md](AI-BOUNDARIES.md)**.

## Skills

### API Data Sources

| [SOW/PWS Builder](skills/sow-pws-builder) | No key | -- | Structured scope decision tree producing contract-file-ready SOW or PWS. FAR 37.102(d) compliant: staffing handoff for the IGCE Builder is delivered as chat output, never embedded in the document body. Independently tested across 14 runs in two waves and 2 Claude models (163 of 168 assertions passed; 5 patches shipped). [Testing Record](skills/sow-pws-builder/TESTING.md). |

| [OT Project Description Builder](skills/ot-project-description-builder) | No key | -- | Milestone-based project descriptions for prototype OT agreements under 10 USC 4021/4022. Replaces the SOW/PWS for OTs: structures work around TRL progression phases and go/no-go gates instead of task/subtask CLINs. Handles NDC, small business, traditional (with cost sharing), and consortium-brokered agreements. Produces a .docx agreement attachment and a chat-only milestone handoff table for the OT Cost Analysis. |
| [OT Cost Analysis](skills/ot-cost-analysis) | No key* | BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, GSA Per Diem | Should-cost estimates and price reasonableness analyses for OT agreements. Milestone-based pricing citing 10 USC 4021 instead of FAR 15.404. Handles cost-sharing math (10 USC 4022(d)), consortium management fees, fixed-price and cost-type milestone payments, and pre-solicitation budget planning. Produces a formula-driven .xlsx workbook with scenario analysis and a price reasonableness memo for the agreement file. |

*Uses keys from other installed skills. No additional key needed.

## MCP Servers

Want more consistent results across runs? Install the MCP servers. Each of the 8 API data source skills above also ships as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on PyPI. When installed in Claude Desktop or another MCP client, orchestration skills call these servers directly for deterministic tool calls instead of letting Claude generate API request code through SKILL.md instructions alone.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is Anthropic's open standard for LLM applications to communicate with external tools and data sources. MCP servers run locally, expose a set of callable tools, and return structured responses. They work in any MCP-compatible client including [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Continue, and Zed.

### Why use the MCP servers?

- **Deterministic tool calls.** Every call to `search_awards()` produces the same structured output, rather than Claude generating slightly different API request code across runs.
- **Orchestration skills prefer them.** If the SAM.gov MCP is installed, the SOW/PWS Builder and IGCE Builder skills use it for vendor lookups instead of falling back to API-call generation through SKILL.md.
- **Independently hardened.** Each server went through 3 to 6 audit rounds with live testing against the production API. See each TESTING.md for the full record.
- **Published to PyPI with Trusted Publisher.** Install via `uvx` with no manual Python environment setup.

### Install

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) on Mac or Windows.
2. Open `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Paste an `mcpServers` block for each server you want. Example config for all 8:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bls-oews": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["bls-oews-mcp"],
      "env": {"BLS_API_KEY": "your-key-here"}
    },
    "ecfr": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["ecfr-mcp"]
    },
    "federal-register": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["federal-register-mcp"]
    },
    "gsa-calc": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["gsa-calc-mcp"]
    },
    "gsa-perdiem": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["gsa-perdiem-mcp"],
      "env": {"PERDIEM_API_KEY": "your-key-here"}
    },
    "regulations-gov": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["regulationsgov-mcp"],
      "env": {"REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY": "your-key-here"}
    },
    "sam-gov": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["sam-gov-mcp"],
      "env": {"SAM_API_KEY": "your-key-here"}
    },
    "usaspending": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["usaspending-gov-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop.
5. Orchestration skills will use the installed MCP servers automatically when available.

See [API Keys](#api-keys) below for where to get free keys for the 4 servers that need them. `ecfr`, `federal-register`, `gsa-calc`, and `usaspending` need no key.

Across all 8 MCPs: 719 regression tests covering roughly 350 bugs fixed during hardening.

## Testing and Validation

Skills in this repo are progressively being run through independent end-to-end validation. Each testing wave uses the following methodology:

- Scenarios are run on claude.ai web chat, the same environment real users run in.
- Each worker output is graded by a separate Claude instance (Claude Code Opus 4.7 with 1M context, max effort) reading only the final artifact and chat transcript, with no access to the worker's drafting reasoning.
- Grading is binary pass/fail against a 14-point assertion matrix covering FAR compliance, document structure, voice consistency, and handoff format.
- Findings that surface real bugs or consistent behavioral gaps become skill patches.
- Every tested skill ships with a public Testing Record documenting methodology, results, and changes made.

### MCP Servers Testing Records

MCP servers use a different testing methodology from the skills above: instead of scenario-graded assertions, each server was hardened through multi-round live audits targeting input validation, response-shape fragility, and silent-wrong-data bugs. Each was probed against its production API with edge cases, injection attempts, boundary values, and unusual response shapes. See each TESTING.md for the round-by-round breakdown.

| MCP | Audit rounds | Regression tests | Bugs fixed | Testing Record |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [bls-oews-mcp](https://github.com/1102tools/bls-oews-mcp) | 5 | 60 | 22 | [Testing Record](https://github.com/1102tools/bls-oews-mcp/blob/main/TESTING.md) |
